This repository is arranged in 3 folders:
scripts: Contains all the R scripts used for all the analyses presented in the article.<br />
cleandata: Contains RDS objects ready to be read in R. These objects are organized structures of data required to reproduce all the results and figures in the manuscript <br />
rawdata: Contains tab delimited files with adittional data. <br />

### Scripts
We utilized prefixes to separate the scripts in different categories. Additionally we numbered the scripts in each category. To reproduce all analyses for a category please be sure to run the scripts according to the numeric order. <br />
amplicon_bacteria : These scripts analyze the bacterial census data <br />
amplicon_fungi: These scripts analyze the fungal census data <br />
amplicon_phenotypes: These scripts analyze the phenotypic data obtained from the plants grown in the Halle soils <br />
amplicon_syncom: These scripts analyze the data from the Synthetic Community experiments <br />
rnaseq_hallepi: These scripts analyze the transcriptomic data obtained from plants grown in the Halle soils <br />
rnaseq_syncom: These scripts analyze the transcriptomic data from the SynCom agar experiment <br />
amplicon_create_suptable: Scripts to create the supplementary tables that populate the manuscript <br />
